# stikki ðŸš§
localised self-hosted bulletin-board-alike system for managing notes as an individual or group.

## Incentives
- The server will run using node.js with mySQL as a database.
- I intend to provide a CLI as the main form of interaction with the application, however a web interface and mobile app will probably come later.
- The serverside application will be avaliable as a docker package to be executed on something like a raspberry pi.

Just a note that at this point the entire project is literally just an idea, but I will get to work soon. It'll be a big undertaking so if anyone wants to help later on, help would be greatly appreciated - I am not exactly experienced with either node or SQL.




wow I just read this over...do I even know how to speak english?
