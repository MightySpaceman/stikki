self-hosted bulletin-board-alike system for managing notes as an individual or group.
Serverside application oriented to running on small devices like a raspberry pi, using node.js with SQL as a database. Client will be predominantly avaliable as a CLI, however it would definitely be possible to implement a LAN web application and therefore a subsequent mobile webapp. To get it to work across the internet would require port forwarding set up on the router, but that's not that hard unless you are setting something like this up at a school where you don't have network privelages/are friends with someone with them.

Just a note that at this point the entire project is literally just an idea, but I will get to work soon. It'll be a big undertaking so if anyone wants to help later on, help would be greatly appreciated - I am not exactly experienced with either node or SQL.




wow I just read this over...do I even know how to speak english?
