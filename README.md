self-hosted bulletin-board-alike system for managing notes as an individual or group.
Serverside application oriented to running on small devices like a raspberry pi, using node.js with SQL as a database. Client is more oriented towards a CLI, however it would definitely be possible to implement a LAN web application and therefore a subsequent mobile webapp.

Just a note that at this point the entire project is literally just an idea, but I will get to work soon. It'll be a big undertaking so if anyone wants to help later on, help would be greatly appreceated - I am not exactly experienced with either node or SQL.
