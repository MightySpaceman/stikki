# stikki ðŸš§
localised self-hosted bulletin-board-alike system for managing notes as an individual or group.

## Incentives
- The server will run using node.js with mySQL as a database.
- I intend to provide a CLI as the main form of interaction with the application, however a web interface and mobile app will probably come later. It's not that difficult to make a webapp for something as simple as this, and transferring it to a mobile application is not that hard if you already have the pure HTML/CSS/Frontend JS.
- The serverside application will be avaliable as a docker package to be executed on something like a raspberry pi.
- The webapp GUI will feature a visual interface of a literal bulletin board. Multiple boards will be able to store different sets of 'stickies', corresponding to different categories.

## Todo (Short-term)
Work out mySQL integration with node [ ]

Just a note that at this point the entire project is literally just an idea, but I am working to make it a reality, even though I am a complete noob to JS. It'll be a big undertaking so if anyone wants to help later on, that would be greatly appreciated.
